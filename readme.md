# react-ssr-demo

This is a simple demo for _Server-Side Rendering_ in react, which can be a useable SSR framework.

We use:

- _pnpm_: the best package manager for now
- _webpack_: for parsing dependencies and make bundles
- _babel_: for translating react to javascript
- _redux_: for managing global states
- _react-router_: for front-end and back-end routing

### Branches

- main: Simplest SSR demo
- feat_router: SSR with `react-router`
- feat_redux: SSR with `redux`
- feat_thunk: SSR with data pre-fetching
